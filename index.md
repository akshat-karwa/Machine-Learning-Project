## Spotify Hit and Genre Classification

The music industry has experienced significant evolution over the past two decades with the advent of streaming services. With streaming and social media changing consumption patterns, the evolution of culture can be directly pulsed through changes in music preferences [1]. Therefore, for streaming services like Spotify, understanding the dynamics of song popularity and genres has become essential to curating the customer experience. Our project aims to delve into this musical transformation by analyzing the "Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019" dataset, which is composed of the 100 chart-topping songs from each year [2].
